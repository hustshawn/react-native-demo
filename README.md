react-native-demo 
=================================================================
This is a react native app demo, that demonstrates a list of artists with their corresponding introduction and their talk sessions in by calendars.

For someone who are new to React Native, it may help you have a basic understanding on how react native works from a very simple start.

I believe, any simple app should have its architecture, even this simple app has no exception. Basically, it composed with 3 tabs at the bottom, and each of them going to its corresponding page and routed respectively, as what we experienced in Facebook app, no matter how much layers you get into each of the tab, you can switch back from another tab.
 
And the most basic thing to develop an app is to have a list view and the routing. In this app, the NavigatorIOS and ListView are introduced.


A simple **React Native** app with yarn/npm as package management.
